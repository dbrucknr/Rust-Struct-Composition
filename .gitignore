# Cargo.lock is generated by Cargo and tracks exact dependency versions.
# It should generally be committed to ensure reproducible builds.
# However, if you are building a library that is not meant to be a standalone application,
# or if you have specific reasons to manage dependencies differently,
# you might consider ignoring it.
